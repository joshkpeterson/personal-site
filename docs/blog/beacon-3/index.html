            How might we make interactive land art? This project is one answer
            for this question, and I want to open-source the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to see people making art with technology continue to become
            more I had been considering sharing everything, and then American
            Public Art in Boston created a patreon where they’re starting to
            release info around hardware / software / materials / process and it
            inspired me to take this leap. This work will take a number of
            months to execute and I’ll be sharing updates at major milestones.
          </p>

          <p>
            While I was in college in Seattle I made an interactive project
            using a big handheld spotlight, a pair of walkie-talkies, and an
            arduino. Seattle is very hilly, and on one hill I put the spotlight.
            Then from another hill one mile away, you could control the
            spotlight with your voice. At that distance, the light looked like
            any other streetlight – a tiny spec. But it only turned on when you
            were speaking into the walkie-talkie. I made a short film about
            setting the project up and using it, the light flashing on and off
            with every syllable you spoke.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to make another version of this project in Seattle again, but
            at a very large scale. Seattle is surrounded by mountains – to the
            east are the Cascades, and to the west are the Olympics. They’re a
            defining feature of the landscape – they’re the horizon, the walls
            of the container that holds the city (though the mountains
            themselves are icons of the wilderness that surrounds the city). I
            want to put a light out in these mountains, 35 miles away, that
            anyone can control in the city by visiting a url on their phone and
            speaking into it.
          </p>

          <p>Some thoughts about what the piece means to me:</p>

          <p>
            • It may turn out to be an extreme digital interaction that will be
            worthwhile in itself. Someone using this will never have experienced
            anything like it before. Seeing a light turn on when you speak at
            the distance of 1 mile, or even 100 yards, is uncanny. At 35 miles
            it may be really strange and awe-inspiring. • In one sense, this is
            conceptually similar with posting something on the internet. You hit
            a button on your phone with your fingers, and thousands of miles
            away a server activates, and pixels on someone else’s phone sends
            light into their eyeballs. I’m interested in playing with bringing
            this action-at-a-distance to the largest scale that one person can
            immediately experience. • What is a city? What are the limits of a
            city? All these lights and other utilities that surround us and are
            interactive to varying degrees, what do they say to us? Are they
            benevolent? • I take a lot of inspiration from the Light and Space
            movement, especially Robert Irwin. o The idea of site-specific art:
            a piece that leverages the features of its environment. It can only
            exist in that place it was designed for – if you move it, it’s
            changed. The context is part of the work. o The tactic of stripping
            a work down further and further because that’s one way to make art
            that can get at fundamental principles of experience. This piece is
            really just one pixel, far away. o A fascination with the perception
            of space. I’m interested in how drawing attention to this tiny light
            as far as the eye can see will protract or flatten someone’s sense
            of distance and their larger environment.
          </p>

          <p>Now onto the how. There are a few different components.</p>

          <p>[image]</p>

          <p>
            A light visible at 35 miles needs to be extremely bright, so only a
            radio tower beacon will do. This will be powered by a solar
            generator consisting of a solar panel, a battery, and a BMS (Battery
            Management System) that handles the charging and output. There are
            newer LED beacons that use less power. Radio tower obstruction
            lights are normally omnidirectional (the unidirectional ones are
            typically strobes, which won’t work for this), but I actually want
            focused light. Additionally, the light may not be bright enough to
            be very visible at 35 miles. So I may build a custom reflector.
          </p>

          <p>
            The light will be turned on and off using a solid state relay
            controlled by a cellular-radio enabled IOT board. I’ve selected the
            Particle Electron because it’s more plug and play than using other
            things e.g. the Raspberry Pi for this application. Resilient, if it
            power dies temporarily it’ll come on and connect to the internet
            automatically. This would take work to configure with a R-pi. Also
            probably lower power. It has a community and core libraries for TCP
            client. I’ll get a cell antenna.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cell data. Woah boy, it’s weird. Particle as a data service, but
            I’ll be using too much at the rate I’m sending (include calc from
            forum). CDMA vs GSM. Verizon doesn’t work with particle because GSM
            only. Rates are weird, expensive. Going with Ting, which is a good
            deal, pay as you go data somewhat? More made for iot, too. But
            cellular still wtf because of latency, estimating signal
            (opensignal).
          </p>

          <p>
            Web infra: Socket io because ease of use, perf not important for #
            of users (100 max?) Basic check for location using cdn, then maybe
            gps although it adds friction. OSM. Logic: mixes all incoming
            signals, dynamic based on # inputs. Dashboard: logging for
            prototyping, documentation, managing bad actors Passes to iot board
            via tcp
          </p>

          <p>
            Front end: Don’t send audio – privacy. Low pass filter essentially,
            sending numbers over websocket. Fps? For my project, I just need: •
            One device over cellular • Receive a number 0 - 255 and pwm an
            output pin accordinly • Rate: Ideally 25 times per second, maybe
            10/sec minimum • 16 hours a day Running the math… This page1 says a
            short particle.publish is 128 bytes. So 128 bytes x 25/sec x 60 sec
            x 60 min x 16 hours = 184 megabytes. Just per day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Custom reflector – may not be bright enough. Design + fab parabolic
            reflector and/or Fresnel lens. Brightness overall might mean more
            dynamic range, better also for foggy condition
          </p>

          <p>
            There are some non-technical challenges to executing this piece too.
          </p>

          <p>
            Selecting a site. Since I don’t live in Seattle, I’ve used google
            maps to stake out a lot of the land surrounding the city. I also
            need permission. To the east, the land covering the nearby Cascades
            is managed by a corporation. To the west, it’s managed by the
            National Forest Service. Using NFS land is highly regulated and
            there’s a protracted process, and it would be much easier to just
            send the corporation a letter. NFS actually requires that you pursue
            non-public options for your use first, so I’ll go with that. I might
            create a video, or pursue an even more creative tact. Christos art
            required a lot of this, and the process of getting permission even
            became part of the work. It’s a different story when you are an
            early career unknown artist, though.
          </p>

          <p>
            Either way, I may be required to get a Professional Engineer to look
            over my light and wiring and make sure it’s not a fire hazard. Even
            if it’s not legally required, I might do it anyway because it will
            make me and probably my hosts feel better. PE’s are often engaged
            for public art projects. I need to find one though, and I’m not sure
            the best way to go about that. Been following some word of mouth
            leads with other artists.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, I need to check that this light will be legal by FAA
            standards. It’s hard to understand if it is just by reading their
            regulations, because my use-case is so atypical – flashing white
            medium intensity at night. Usually it’s flashing red at night, or
            flashing white high intensity during the day. This may be allowed by
            I may have to make accommodations, for example I may have to put on
            the top of a ridge instead of on the side, or even put it on a radio
            tower, or even change the color to red.
          </p>

          <p>
            Setup is going to require flying over to Seattle, probably doing
            some fab there, and then assembling a team of people to help
            install. I’ll have to rent a truck and maybe get permits to access
            land. I may have to secure some space to do staging/testing. Then,
            I’ll also want to take footage of setting the project up to use in
            documentation/ video version of the work, and take footage of people
            using it while I’m there. So I’ll need to rent video equipment and
            do some storyboarding to plan what my final project ideal would be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Publicity. I’m inspired by the Now Rise project and the confusion it
            caused. I also would like it to slowly catch on. That’s actually a
            key part of the work for me – the social dimension. I may flyer in
            places that have line of sight to break out of my social bubble
            without using press that I myself commission. Flyers will have to be
            designed carefully because of the type of messaging/framing they
            give the piece.
          </p>

          <p>
            The front end design will have to be carefully considered too. It’ll
            be really minimal and dark so it doesn’t ruin people’s night vision.
          </p>

          <p>
            And there’s another problem that’s a crossover between tech and
            non-tech. Mitigating abuse. There might be bad actors, it’ll be
            possible to troll the game and make it unusable for other people.
            I’ll need to set up some quick and dirty defenses against people
            gaming it, as well as using it from other locations outside of
            Seattle, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to totally protect it.
            Also what I have in mind will be really time intensive – like might
            take just as much time as writing the rest of the app, so I may have
            to work on it once the thing is already launched, hoping it won’t go
            viral and attract “hackers” right away.
