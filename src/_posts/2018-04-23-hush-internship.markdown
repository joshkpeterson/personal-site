excerpt: Wrapping up a 6 month creative tech internship

---

I just finished a 6-month Creative Tech internship at HUSH,

where I got to flex a lot of different muscles on a bunch of projects:  🌀 I was 1 of 2 developers on an AR app, made with Unity. It was part of a package with an accompanying physical sculpture sent out to clients. You can read more about it here, or download on the app store and try it yourself!

🌴 Circuit soldering and on-site installation for an epic interactive piece for Chobani at Grand Central Station.

🎲 Miscellaneous scripting in js and python to wrangle datasets and thousands of image assets for Facebook and Capital One installations, which had generative data visualizations.

📊 Backend web development in python/flask for a Facebook installation’s CMS. Frontend web development on an analytics dashboard with charts.

👨‍🎨 Concept generation, visual + interaction design, and hardware prototyping for an installation at Instagram’s new SF office.

🎨 Design for various pitches.

I'm continuing to freelance at HUSH for now. Ask me what I'm up to!
